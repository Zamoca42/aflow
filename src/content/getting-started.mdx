# Getting Started

This guide will help you get started with AFlow, a tool that helps you visualize and understand GitHub repository structures using AI-powered architecture diagrams.

## Authenticate with GitHub

1. Click the "Sign in with GitHub" button in the sidebar
2. You'll be redirected to A.flow GitHub app's Authorization or Installation page
   ![GitHub App Installation](/images/github-auth.png)
3. Review the requested permissions:
   - Read access to your repositories
   - Read access to your email address
4. Click "Authorize" or "Install" to proceed

## Generate Architecture Diagram

1. Select a repository from the sidebar
2. Click the "AI Visualizer" button in the repository header
3. Wait for the diagram to be generated

This is an example of the generated architecture diagram:

{<div className="component-content"><VisualizeTab mermaidCode={EXAMPLE_MERMAID_CODE} isCached={true} repoName={"example"} /></div>}

### Understanding the Visualizer Interface

The visualizer has two main tabs:

**Preview Tab**:
- View the generated architecture diagram
- Use zoom controls (bottom right)
- Download as SVG
- Check if result is cached (âš¡icon)

**Code Tab**:
- View and copy the mermaid code
- Use in your own documentation

## Manage your private repositories

To access private repositories, you'll need to explicitly grant access:

1. Click the "Manage Private Repository" button in the sidebar
2. You'll see a list of your private repositories
   ![Private Repos Management](/images/private-repos.png)
3. Select repositories you want to access and click "Save"
4. Selected private repositories will appear in your sidebar under the "Private" section
